# Partisan Bot Tweet Locator

## Bot Tweet Locator is an app which lets you observe coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIBs), i.e bot generated content propogation on twitter. Currentlly the app looks at dataset of tweets about presidential candidates which were geolocated.

Users can see where the content was generated by accounts with different bot probabilities.

Data: This data is was collected from data world. However I added the columns of bot probability and geo locations. These two attributes were filled with made up data. Names of the tweeter and mesage Id were annonomized.  


How Does it work?

1) Choose the candidate you are interested in 
2) Choose bot probability of tweeters 
3) Speciafy the tweet time-frame

What can you see?
1) Reactive map shows geographic location the tweet originated from based on the search criterias entered by the user
2) Reference map in sidebar shows how different counties voted in Presidential election of 2020
3) Plots that will show you distribution of tweets by date, positive - negative score and sentiment
4) Actual tweets for teh selected consitions


Enjoy!
